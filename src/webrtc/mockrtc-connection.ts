         * When proxying traffic, you effectively have four peers, each with a connection endpoint:
         * - The incoming RTCPeerConnection that we're mocking ('internal')
         * - This MockRTC connection, with an associated MockRTCPeer that it will actually connect to ('mock')
         * - A MockRTC external connection that will connect to the remote peer ('external')
         * - The original remote peer that we're connecting to ('remote')
         *
         * Once the proxy is set up, the the connection structure works like so:
         * INTERNAL <--> MOCK <--> EXTERNAL <--> REMOTE
         *
         * Here we connect the internal & external connections together, proxying all behaviours between the
         * two so that from this point forwards every event on one is reflected on the other.
         *
         * Note that this isn't necessarily the initialization of either connection: the remote peer could
         * have been connected for a while (sending data with no response), and the internal peer could have
         * been fully interacting with steps before this point.
